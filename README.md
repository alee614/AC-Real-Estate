Discover new villagers and manage your ideal set of villagers on your Animal Crossing New Horizon's remote island.

Included in the repository is server.js, dump file, and the frontend code.

Limited function for specific users, but displays information and categorizes all villagers and incorporates react-google-login library.

Preliminary run through of the project can be seen here: https://youtu.be/w7lO02BIGH4

Future work includes user's being able to edit and create different types of lists to save for future reference.  A recipe calculator has also been requested and is currently under review.
